# Project-1

*user story*
As a music lover I want to be able to find more playlists of music that I enjoy
When I find new music I wanna be able to sample it, I want the playlist to display, and I want a filter to exclude genres I donâ€™t like
So that I can enjoy new playlist that I will be able to enjoy to listen to
